# Case Workflow Design

## Overview
This document outlines the design for handling multi‑step contact attempts, deadlines, Wellbeing Reviews (WBR), follow‑ups, and 3/6 month check‑ins. The system will use multiple CSV files to track active cases, contact attempts, archived cases, and later check‑ins.

## Data Storage

### 1. Active Cases (Cases.csv)
- Contains the main details of each case:
  - User Number (unique identifier, e.g. #RC1234)
  - Personal details: UserNumber, FirstName, Surname, DOB, etc.
  - Contact info: PhoneNumber, EmailAddress, Postcode, etc.
  - High‑level fields: Status, DeadlineDate, WellbeingReviewDate, WBRSentDate, FollowUpDate

### 2. Contact Attempts (ContactAttempts.csv)
- One row per contact attempt.
- Columns: 
  - User Number
  - AttemptNumber (1, 2, 3, …)
  - ContactDate
  - Method (Phone, Email, Text, etc.)
  - Notes
  - Reply (Yes/No)

### 3. Archived Cases (ArchivedCases.csv)
- When a case is complete or closed, it is moved here.
- Same columns as Cases.csv plus ArchiveDate.

### 4. 3/6 Month Check‑Ins (ThreeSixMonthChecks.csv)
- Stores future check‑ins for cases that are complete.
- Columns:
  - User Number
  - CheckType (3-Month or 6-Month)
  - PlannedDate
  - CompletedDate (optional)
  - Notes

## Timeline/Workflow

1. **Case Creation**
   - Status starts as "New" or "Awaiting 1st Contact"
   - A task is created for the 1st contact, due within 5 working days.

2. **First Contact Attempt**
   - Record attempt details in ContactAttempts.csv.
   - If user replies, status moves to "In Conversation"
   - If no reply, status remains "Awaiting Reply."

3. **Second Contact Attempt**
   - Scheduled 5 working days after 1st contact.
   - Record attempt details.
   - Status updates accordingly.

4. **Third Contact Attempt & Deadline**
   - Scheduled 5 working days after 2nd attempt.
   - If still no reply, set a DeadlineDate 5 working days later.
   - After deadline passes, case can be marked "Closed" (and then moved to ArchivedCases.csv).

5. **Wellbeing Review (WBR)**
   - If contact is successful, schedule a WBR call.
   - The WBR should take place, and then the WBR must be sent (within 10 working days).
   - Status: "WBR In Progress" → "WBRSent"

6. **Follow-Up**
   - Follow-up contact is attempted 10 working days after the WBR is sent.
   - Status: "FollowUpPending" → "FollowUpComplete"

7. **3/6 Month Check‑Ins**
   - After the WBR is sent, schedule a separate check‑in 3 or 6 months later.
   - These are stored in ThreeSixMonthChecks.csv.
   - Completed checks are logged and may trigger further follow‑ups if needed.

8. **Case Completion**
   - A case can only be marked complete if all necessary steps are done:
     - Either all contact attempts have been made (and deadline passed) with no reply, or
     - The user has gone through the WBR and follow‑up.
   - Once complete, the case is moved from Cases.csv to ArchivedCases.csv.

## Additional Considerations and Edge Cases

- **User Replies Early:**  
  - If a user responds after the 1st or 2nd attempt, skip subsequent attempts.
- **Deadline Management:**  
  - Compute due dates considering weekends (only working days).
- **Task Dashboard:**  
  - Use a separate CSV (or even a database table) for tasks, listing each case’s pending steps with due dates.
- **Dynamic Contact Attempts:**  
  - Use ContactAttempts.csv to allow an unlimited number of attempts.
- **3/6 Month Checks:**  
  - Use a separate CSV so that completed cases don’t clutter your active case list.

## Implementation Summary

- **Active Cases**: Cases.csv (main data)
- **Contact Attempts**: ContactAttempts.csv (one row per attempt)
- **Archived Cases**: ArchivedCases.csv (completed cases)
- **Follow-Up Checks**: ThreeSixMonthChecks.csv (for later check‑ins)

This document will serve as the blueprint for implementing the entire workflow.
